# Responsive Web Design Course
In this certification program, I delved into the fundamental languages used by developers to craft visually appealing and user-friendly webpages.



## Overview
This certification focuses on two key languages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and design. Through a series of hands-on projects and exercises, I've progressively enhance my skills, starting from building a basic cat photo app to mastering advanced techniques like CSS variables and best practices for accessibility.
